Notes
#############################################
0. In order for this to run, it needs to be outside the colesecure network and have storybook running...
1. We can do testcafe test in component library. But we should really do mobile test in the app level.
   storybook is not good for e2e on different browser sizing, e.g. it only got 4 sizes.
2. Will Add Util for mobile test on app later (usually it is the hamburger view)
3. Explain the structure for mobile vs deskstop testing
   A. divide file into desktop set and mobile set.
   B. group them all under one file and have -mobile.ts for mobile file, -desktop.ts for desktop file. and use util class.
4. -c 5. This doesn't seem to make it slower...
5. All the test cafe test is not triggered in android studio and xcode atm.
   Latest version of android studio only have pixer emulator. Previous version got samsung. The current version got it removed.
   We can download the samsung skin for the emulator but underneath OS does not change.
   Samsung does offer virtual testing machine for 30 mins usage.
   Suggest not to worry about real devices for now.
6. Good things about testcafe is that it is more aligned with css selector than cypress.
7. If you want to run specific file you can do: testcafe chrome testcafe-suite/button.spec.tc
8. We can change the testcafe-suite folder name people prefer another name.
9. Do you guys want the sample-test-page.spec.ts file to be there?

Problem with safari
==========================
- Don't seem to be able to resize with width=400;height=800;
    "tc:safari:iphone": "testcafe 'safari:emulation:device=iphone 12;width=400;height=800;' testcafe-suite",

- Don't seem to be able to do headless;
    "tc:annie": "testcafe 'safari:headless:emulation:device=iphone 12' testcafe-suite",

- As long as the test suite for safari, it cannot do headless, which means we cannot test it as CI:CD???


Problem with firefox
=========================
- No mobile version.
