Application Performance Management or Monitoring (APM) is essential for any web application to provide a better user experience.

----------------

Frontend application monitoring is the process of tracking errors, fixing them, and maintaining the health of web applications.
It is done to optimize user experience by removing any kind of error that could be harmful to your application.
You can catch errors at the initial stage, which would be easy for your developers to tackle. Subsequently, they can work on debugging and improving the code.

Don’t confuse it with application performance monitoring because it focuses on the ultimate result that users can see while opening your application.

- Network request failure
    monitoring tools can record those HTTP requests and the responses initiated by the user to find the errors.
- Performance issues
    Some monitoring tools can also track app performance metrics, including average page loading time, time-to-first-paint, average server response time, and more.
- User experience problems
    (not sure how to monitor these) If a user performs “rage clicks” or clicks some elements quickly for multiple times, the tools can effectively monitor this. Additionally, they can also ensure elements are rendered correctly and detected when a user gets stuck in a certain navigation loop.

Sentry:
- $80/month for business package. Not sure for enterprice package.
- With Breadcrumbs, you can see the events leading to the errors, which helps you prioritize the bugs based on their possible impact on users and your business.
  Sentry tells you things you must know to detect errors and find them based on the overall context.
- The tool is capable of associating errors with a specific release.
  With the release feature, you can see when and who caused the bug or error to happen, and it also provides additional context such as commit data,
- This context also defines the error environment, i.e., language and operating system.

LogRocket:
- LogRocket lets you playback user sessions so you can see the pixel-perfect view of everything whatever your users can view in real-time.
- View network activity, including response and request. You can also inspect state and actions during a specific time along with JavaScript errors and console logs.
- LogRocket lets you track IP address and user-agent tracking for each session, which is also useful in providing information about what browser they are using and troubleshooting problems specific to their browsers.

Rollbar
- Rollbar automates triaging and error monitoring so developers could fix errors within minutes while building software painlessly.
- It provides real-time results in addition to stacking traces against local variables.

AppSignal
- The five types of monitoring
  Error tracking to detect error and ensure it doesn't repeat
  Performance monitoring to fine-tune your app
  Server monitoring to run healthy applications on optimal hardware
  Metric dashboards to collect real-time metrics and then visualize them in your dashboard
  Anomaly detection to set triggers plus receive alerts in case any of the metrics go wrong.

Airbrake
- It is a lightweight and simple tool that you can set up easily and get it running in no time.
- The moment an error occurs in your application, it notifies you with real-time alerts.
- Find the root cause of the error through Breadcrumbs and Backtraces that display the exact cause responsible for the error, simplifying its fixing.

New Relic:
- Application Monitoring – monitoring everything you need to understand the application performance & capacity. For ex:
  How much time take to load the page?
  What is the most time-consuming transaction?
  What is the throughput and error rate?
  Monitor critical transaction with breakdown and traceback
- Along with the monitoring, you can do thread profiling, use Java performance analyzer for performance-related troubleshooting.
- Database Monitoring – most likely, you will be using some database with your enterprise application, and you can do following out of the box with New Relic.
  Track the slow running queries
  How much time is spent on database requests?
  Visualize database operation
  Database call response time & throughput
- Alerting – alerting is essential for a production environment. With the help of New Relic, you can configure the alert policies to notify when a threshold is breached. You can integrate alerting with the channel such as email, Jira, Pager Duty, etc.

App Dynamics:
- (Backend code monitoring?) App Dynamics APM supports many platforms, including Java, Node.js, Apache HTTP, Python, PHP.

Datadog:
- It monitors full-stack, including application & infrastructure, to provide visibility at each layer of the stack.
- Datadog provides an advanced dashboard for visualizing the metrics matter to you. For ex;
  Latency
  Errors per second
  Hits per second
  CPU/Memory utilization


Checklist -->
- Check how good the dashboard of the tool is for analyzing information.
- Whether the tool includes an API reference or not
- Find out how many integrations the tool supports to keep using other apps and services.
- How deep the tool can trace the issues.
- Check whether the tool provides the option for on-premise.
- The tool must have good security features.
- The service provider must be offering quality technical support through multiple channels and 24/7 availability.
- Last but not least, pick the service in-line with your budget. For this, check multiple services, compare the offerings and pricing, and then go for the right combination.

The inclusion of a log message collector, a server, and a consolidator
The ability to create logfile names with meaningful structure and rotate them, opening new files periodically
The creation and maintenance of a log file directory structure
A data viewer that includes data analysis functions, such as filtering and sorting
Data portability
The offer of a free demo or trial for a no-cost assessment
A good deal that offers valuable services at a reasonable price

Questions to evaluation:
- price.
- platform that it run. (preferred window and Mac)
- have a dashboard.
- have easy called function and configuration for setup.
- can hook into alert system to trigger email/slack msg/sms when the threadhold is reached.
- able to track user steps to generate the error.
-

Questions to ask:
- How AppDynamic is installed into the app?
- Is it able to keep track of an error from frontend all the way to the backend log, e.g. if it's a backend problem?
- How do you use with splunk? To filter the log? What else do you use splunk for?
- What standard info is the dashboard provided?

- Is it able to catch runtime error?
- Do you catch api call error in the try{}catch{} block? What else do you logging in the application?

- Do you find it easy to use? What is the learning curve?
- How long do you guys keep the log, does it got erase when it reach certain max limit in size or passes xx days?
- Is the dev team actively monitor the log? Or another team? Is there alert triggered be setup? E.g. if pass X number of error per minute?
- Do we have an enterprise licence for these two tools? What is their technical support channels like? 24/7?
- What do you don't like about AppDynamic and Splunk and what feature you wish you have?
- Do you have experience using other tools before and what are they like?

============================================
They consider monitoring as a part of their operational efforts, and they usually leave it to an Ops engineer or sysadmin
for that matter. It may not be a healthy practice as it overburdens them and might result in loopholes.

    Annie, you need to be more specific. We do use - appDynamics  within Coles for some websites, speak to Markus Blaser to get a full run down on whether this provides what you require since you mention client side - which I'm sure AppD could do. There are Adobe tools that can provide device information etc which are in use - see Jacob Toy. Again, more info required.
